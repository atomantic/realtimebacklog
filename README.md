## Demo

note: currently this is just docs.

The dev branch of this codebase is continuously built and deployed with Travis on Github pages: [the realtimebacklog demo site](http://atomantic.github.io/realtimebacklog)


## Why
### TODO lists aren't good enough.

If you are good at a lot of things, you are never short of things to do. Managing your queue can be tricky, especially if you have to balance different projects, schedules and delivery expectations across parts of your life: family, work, self-fulfillment, friends, etc.

This application provides a task queue management system, in which a user can tag tasks/projects with difficulty rating, where it fits in a life or daily plan and whether not it will actually get done. Unlike typical TODO lists or backlog management systems where items can fester and never get done, this tool stacks tasks in a live backlog, color coding them and placing them in such a way as to alert the user and any guest viewers when/if a task will reach the "doing it" state.
